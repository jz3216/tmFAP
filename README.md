Scripts here serve as demos of how to generate designs similar to the reported [wFAPs](/wFAP/) and [tmFAPs](/tmFAP/). For detailed description of the code's functionality, the rationale behind, and the key input parameters, please refer to the Methods section of the manuscript.  

The [tmFAP](/tmFAP/) folder also contains the scripts for hallucination of transmembrane span in general.
