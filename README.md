# De novo design of transmembrane fluorescence-activating proteins

This repository contains the design models and scripts for this manuscript:

'De novo design of transmembrane fluorescence-activating proteins', Zhu et al., Nature 2024. (to update the citation)

---
Scripts here serve as demos of how to generate designs similar to the reported [wFAPs](/wFAP/) and [tmFAPs](/tmFAP/). For detailed description of the code's functionality, the rationale behind, and the key input parameters, please refer to the Methods section of the manuscript.  

The [tmFAPs](/tmFAP/) folder also contains the scripts for hallucination of transmembrane span in general, compatible with the current verion of the ColabDesign framework (v1.1.1).
